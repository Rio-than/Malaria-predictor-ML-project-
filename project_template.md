Project Title
[Malaria Cell Detection Using Machine Learning and Feature Engineering]

##Project Summary
This project aims to classify whether a given cell image is malaria-infected or not. It is undertaken as part of a Statistical Machine Learning course and involves a comprehensive analysis of feature extraction techniques such as HOG, LBP, SIFT, SURF, and raw pixel values. The features are further refined using feature reduction techniques like PCA and LDA, and normalized using Z-score and Min-Max Scaling. A range of machine learning models is trained, evaluated, and compared, including Naive Bayes, SVM, XGBoost, Bagging, AdaBoost, KNN, and Random Forest. Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC are used to assess model performance.

##Problem Statement
Malaria remains one of the most life-threatening diseases in many parts of the world. Manual diagnosis through microscopic analysis of blood cells is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project seeks to automate the detection of malaria-infected cells using machine learning models trained on cellular image features. The dataset includes microscopic images of parasitized and uninfected cells. Through extensive feature extraction, reduction, and classification, the goal is to develop a highly accurate and interpretable model that can aid in the early and efficient diagnosis of malaria.
